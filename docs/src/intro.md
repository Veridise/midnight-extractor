# Introduction

This is the documentation for `midnight-extractor`, 
a tool that extracts selected Halo2 circuits from Midnight's codebase into PCL,
the language used by Picus for analyzing ZK circuits.

The documentation is divided in two parts, the **User manual** and the **Developer manual**.

The **User manual** contains the instructions for building and using the tool, and a tutorial
on how to use AuditHub for uploading extracted circuits and verifying them with Picus.

The **Developer manual** describes how to write new harnesses and how to add support for 
new chips and types.

Click on the right arrow to continue through the **User manual** or you can jump directly to 
the [**Developer manual**](./new_harness.md).
